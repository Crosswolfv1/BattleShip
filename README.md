# BattleShip DO 'bundle install' prior to running the game
## This is the README for the Battleship project for Jeremiah & Montana
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
> We sat down in a slack huddle and created 95 lines of pseudocode following the requirements and how it would function, then we modified it further to be functional to determine how the code should be written, we then created a game class to handle all the functions and migrated them to that class
2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
> The computer class, I want to make it smarter, but I am not sure how to approach it
> expanding the board so you can create longer ships
3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
> We started off with ping pong for the cell and ship, it allowed us to do research on how to do parts of it while the other person was coding
> We then migrated to a driver navigator method for the latter classes, alternating who was driving and navigating
> for the game class/runner, we did a driver navigator to make pseudo code as mentioned above, then swapped to ping pong for making the tests and the class itself
4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
> Feedback was good, It was hard to write feedback because we went through the project  70% together and the ping pong was around 30% but feed back was always good and informal on what was happening and what needed to happen.
